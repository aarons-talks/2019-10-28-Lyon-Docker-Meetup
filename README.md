# 2019-10-28-Lyon-Docker-Meetup

My talk from the Lyon, France Docker Meetup on October 28, 2019.

# Slides

The slides are written using [RevealJS](https://revealjs.com). To view the presentation, open `index.html` in your web browser.

# Demo

This demo comes straight from [Servantes](https://github.com/windmilleng/servantes). To try it out, [install Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html) and then run these commands:

```console
$ cd servantes
$ tilt up
```

You'll then have ports 9000-9010 forwarded from your Kubernetes cluster onto `localhost`.
